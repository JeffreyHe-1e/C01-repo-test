# C01-repo-test
Week 1 practice using git

git clone this repo "git clone" [your repo]
create your own local branch with your name "git checkout -b firstname-lastname"
create a new text file "firstname-lastname.txt"
put whatever you want in it - "hello world"
git add it and commit it
git push --set-upstream origin [name of your branch]
go to github and create a pull request from your branch to the master branch
merge changes~
